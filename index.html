        Hey visitor, You can call me mostlycryptic. I am a software Engineer (atleast I like to call myself so, not
        because I've a degree but with the curiosity to become one. I'm in a never ending journey to learn. A whole lot
        of it. I never get enough of it.)

        I was previously a research during my Undergraduate days with interests in the field of Cryptography and
        Computational Mathematics. During the brief stint, I was lucky enough to publish my work as a lead author in
        reputed journals. You can look at my work below.

            Applicability of mobile contact tracing in fighting pandemic (COVID-19): Issues, challenges and solutions

            <p>
                We proposed a general evaluation framework/model for the evaluation of mobile contact tracing solutions
                and checked some known contact tracing solutions under the model. We highlighted some issues and
                challenges with the mobile contact tracing solutions as well.
