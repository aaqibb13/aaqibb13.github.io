📍 I'm a Software Engineer at [Verloop](https://www.verloop.io). I'm interesting in building distributed systems, Compiler constructions & workings and database internals.
I'm acquainted with Go, Python, Javascript and Typescript. Trying to sneak into the Rustlang ecosystem as well.

Sometime back, I was a Researcher, mostly interested in the field of cryptography, Computational Mathematics and it's related areas.
I've previously worked on: Contact Tracing Systems, Blockchain driven Access control systems and Lightweight Cryptography.
